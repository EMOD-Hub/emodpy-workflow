# Modify Configuration Parameter

- a. Explain how configuration parameters are simulation wide parameters.
- b. Explain how settings in other areas (campaign and demographics) can impact configuration parameters and vice versa.
- c. Explain how you can sub-class frames so that changes in the base class impact the sub-classes
- d. Use extend_frame to create a new frame off of baseline called higher_base_infectivity
- e. Explain who each file of the frame has two parts, but we will focus on just the initialize_xxx() function for now.
- f. Set Base_Infectifivity
- g. Run EMOD
- h. Use the plotting commands to plot InsetChart and compare to baseline
- i. Tell the user to demonstrate the power of the base class/frame, we will change the Simulation_Duration in baseline
- j. Run EMOD with baseline
- k. Plot InsetChart of new baseline against previous baseline and previous higher_base_infectivity
- l. Run EMOD with higher_base_infectivity
- m. Plot InsetChart of new_higher_base_infectivity against previous higher_base_infectivitycd
